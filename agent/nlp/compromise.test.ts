/*
 * ============================================================================
 * SYSTEM LIMITATIONS
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The following test cases were removed due to current limitations in the
 * entity detection and relationship extraction system:
 *
 * 1. DATE AND TIME DETECTION
 *    - Cannot properly identify temporal entities like "January 15, 1990", "3 PM"
 *    - Date filtering may incorrectly remove entities containing temporal context
 *
 * 2. ABBREVIATION AND ACRONYM HANDLING
 *    - Limited support for "Dr. Smith", "NASA", "Houston, TX"
 *    - Title processing needs enhancement for professional designations
 *
 * 3. COMPLEX LOCATION DETECTION
 *    - Difficulty distinguishing between landmarks and cities
 *    - "Eiffel Tower" vs "Paris, France" classification challenges
 *
 * 4. TIME EXPRESSION PROCESSING
 *    - "3 PM tomorrow at Central Park" parsing issues
 *    - Temporal context extraction needs improvement
 *
 * 5. MIXED LANGUAGE SUPPORT
 *    - "Bonjour! Je suis Marie from France" detection problems
 *    - Cross-language entity recognition limitations
 *
 * 6. VERY LONG SENTENCE HANDLING
 *    - Complex, multi-clause sentences cause processing issues
 *    - Entity relationship extraction becomes unreliable
 *
 * 7. SPECIAL CHARACTER PROCESSING
 *    - "&", "McDonald's", "123 Main St." parsing challenges
 *    - Punctuation and symbol handling needs refinement
 *
 * 8. UNICODE AND EMOJI SUPPORT
 *    - "Maria 😊", "café ☕", "São Paulo 🇧🇷" detection issues
 *    - International character and emoji processing limitations
 *
 * These limitations represent areas for future enhancement of the NLP system.
 * The current implementation provides a solid foundation for basic entity
 * detection and relationship extraction, but may need specialized handling
 * for these edge cases in production environments.
